# RSA Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the RSA algorithm, which is widely used for secure data transmission. The code generates RSA keys, encrypts messages using the public key, and decrypts them using the private key.

## Features

- Generates two large prime numbers for key generation.
- Computes the public and private keys.
- Encrypts messages using the public key.
- Decrypts messages using the private key.
- Validates the primality of numbers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `random` module (included in the standard library)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rsa_algorithm.git
   cd rsa_algorithm
   ```

2. Run the Script
   ```bash
   python rsa_algo.py
   ```
